Exercise 2
- Find all years that have a movie that received a rating of 4 or 5, and sort them in increasing order.

query:
SELECT year FROM movie
INNER JOIN rating
ON movie.mID = rating.mID
WHERE stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5
ORDER BY year ASC;

----

Exercise 3
- Find the titles of all movies that have no ratings.

query:
SELECT title FROM movie
WHERE movie.mID NOT IN(SELECT rating.mID FROM rating);

----

Exercise 4
- Some reviewers didnâ€™t provide a date with their rating. Find the names of all reviewers who have ratings with a NULL value for the date.

query:
SELECT name FROM reviewer
INNER JOIN rating
ON reviewer.rID = rating.rID
WHERE ratingDate IS NULL;

----

Exercise 5
- Write a query to return the ratings data in a more readable format: reviewer name, movie title, stars, and ratingDate. 
Also, sort the data, first by reviewer name, then by movie title, and lastly by number of stars.

query:
SELECT reviewer.name AS name, movie.title AS title, rating.stars AS stars, rating.ratingDate AS ratingdate
FROM rating
INNER JOIN reviewer ON rating.rID = reviewer.rID 
INNER JOIN movie ON rating.mID = movie.mID
ORDER BY reviewer.name ASC, movie.title ASC, rating.stars ASC;
